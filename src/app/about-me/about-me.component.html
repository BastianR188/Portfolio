        As a junior frontend web developer, I independently designed and implemented several web applications using
        JavaScript and Angular. My passion for programming began while working with CNC machines and led me to software
        development. At the TÃœV-certified Developer Academy, I deepened my knowledge and worked on complex projects,
        both independently and as part of a team.
